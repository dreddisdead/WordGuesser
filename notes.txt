    im trying to keep it simple but also make if fun so you want
    to play it more than once. i like it so far, i want to clean 
    it up more before i make it more difficult. im going to try
    separating difficulty with different files in the directory.

    wasnt feeling much of a mood to code today. feeling funky but not
    in a cash money way. decided to relax and take a break.
